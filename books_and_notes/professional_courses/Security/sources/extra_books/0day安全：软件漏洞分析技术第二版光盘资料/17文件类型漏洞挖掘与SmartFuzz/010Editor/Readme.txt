010 Editor                                     - SweetScape Software
--------------------------------------------------------------------

010 Editor (pronounced 'oh-one-oh') is a professional hex editor
containing a whole range of editing and analysis tools. Hex 
editors are used to edit the individual bytes of binary files,
and advanced hex editors such as 010 Editor can also edit hard
drives, floppy drives, memory keys, flash drives, CD-ROMs, 
processes, etc. 010 Editor can open files of any size instantly, 
and features unlimited undo and redo on all editing operations. 
Powerful tools are available for binary files including binary 
compares, check sum/hash algorithms, mathematical operations, 
import/export, find/replace, base converters, plus many more.

One of the most powerful features of 010 Editor is the ability
to parse a binary file using a Binary Template. A Binary Template
is similar to a C/C++ structure but may contain if statements, 
for statements, functions, or expressions. Using a Binary Template,
a file can be more easily understood as a number of variables
than viewing the raw hex bytes. For an example of using Templates,
run 010 Editor and open any BMP, ZIP, or WAV file on your computer.
