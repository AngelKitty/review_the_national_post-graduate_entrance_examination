<H1>12.3  Debug Exceptions</H1>
Two of the interrupt vectors of the 80386 are reserved for exceptions that
relate to debugging. Interrupt 1 is the primary means of invoking debuggers
designed expressly for the 80386; interrupt 3 is intended for debugging
debuggers and for compatibility with prior processors in Intel's 8086
processor family.

<H2>12.3.1 Interrupt 1 -- Debug Exceptions</H2>
The handler for this exception is usually a debugger or part of a debugging
system. The processor causes interrupt 1 for any of several conditions. The
debugger can check flags in DR6 and DR7 to determine what condition caused
the exception and what other conditions might be in effect at the same time.
<A HREF="s12_03.htm#Table 12-2">Table 12-2</A> 
associates with each breakpoint condition the combination of
bits that indicate when that condition has caused the debug exception.
<P>
Instruction address breakpoint conditions are faults, while other debug
conditions are traps. The debug exception may report either or both at one
time. The following paragraphs present details for each class of debug
exception.

<H3>12.3.1.1  Instruction Addrees Breakpoint</H3>
The processor reports an instruction-address breakpoint before it executes
the instruction that begins at the given address; i.e., an instruction-
address breakpoint exception is a fault.
<P>
The RF (restart flag) permits the debug handler to retry instructions that
cause other kinds of faults in addition to debug faults. When it detects a
fault, the processor automatically sets RF in the flags image that it pushes
onto the stack. (It does not, however, set RF for traps and aborts.)
<P>
When RF is set, it causes any debug fault to be ignored during the next
instruction. (Note, however, that RF does not cause breakpoint traps to be
ignored, nor other kinds of faults.)
<P>
The processor automatically clears RF at the successful completion of every
instruction except after the 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instruction, after the 
<A HREF="POPF.htm">POPF</A> instruction,
and after a 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>, 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, or 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> instruction that causes a task switch. These
instructions set RF to the value specified by the memory image of the EFLAGS
register.
<P>
The processor automatically sets RF in the EFLAGS image on the stack before
entry into any fault handler. Upon entry into the fault handler for
instruction address breakpoints, for example, RF is set in the EFLAGS image
on the stack; therefore, the 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instruction at the end of the handler will
set RF in the EFLAGS register, and execution will resume at the breakpoint
address without generating another breakpoint fault at the same address.
<P>
If, after a debug fault, RF is set and the debug handler retries the
faulting instruction, it is possible that retrying the instruction will
raise other faults. The retry of the instruction after these faults will
also be done with RF=1, with the result that debug faults continue to be
ignored. The processor clears RF only after successful completion of the
instruction.
<P>
Real-mode debuggers can control the RF flag by using a 32-bit 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>. A
16-bit 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instruction does not affect the RF bit 
(which is in the
high-order 16 bits of EFLAGS). To use a 32-bit <A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>, the debugger must
rearrange the stack so that it holds appropriate values for the 32-bit EIP,
CS, and EFLAGS (with RF set in the EFLAGS image). Then executing an 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>
with an operand size prefix causes a 32-bit return, popping the RF flag
into EFLAGS.

<H3>12.3.1.2  Data Address Breakpoint</H3>
A data-address breakpoint exception is a trap; i.e., the processor reports
a data-address breakpoint after executing the instruction that accesses the
given memory item.
<P>
When using data breakpoints it is recommended that either the LE or GE bit
of DR7 be set also. If either LE or GE is set, any data breakpoint trap is
reported exactly after completion of the instruction that accessed the
specified memory item. This exact reporting is accomplished by forcing the
80386 execution unit to wait for completion of data operand transfers before
beginning execution of the next instruction. If neither GE nor LE is set,
data breakpoints may not be reported until one instruction after the data is
accessed or may not be reported at all. This is due to the fact that,
normally, instruction execution is overlapped with memory transfers to such
a degree that execution of the next instruction may begin before memory
transfers for the prior instruction are completed.
<P>
If a debugger needs to preserve the contents of a write breakpoint
location, it should save the original contents before setting a write
breakpoint. Because data breakpoints are traps, a write into a breakpoint
location will complete before the trap condition is reported. The handler
can report the saved value after the breakpoint is triggered. The data in
the debug registers can be used to address the new value stored by the
instruction that triggered the breakpoint.

<H3>12.3.1.3  General Detect Fault</H3>
This exception occurs when an attempt is made to use the debug registers at
the same time that ICE-386 is using them. This additional protection feature
is provided to guarantee that ICE-386 can have full control over the
debug-register resources when required. ICE-386 uses the debug-registers;
therefore, a software debugger that also uses these registers cannot run
while ICE-386 is in use. The exception handler can detect this condition by
examining the BD bit of DR6.

<H3>12.3.1.4  Single-Step Trap</H3>
This debug condition occurs at the end of an instruction if the trap flag
(TF) of the flags register held the value one at the beginning of that
instruction.  Note that the exception does not occur at the end of an
instruction that sets TF. For example, if 
<A HREF="POPF.htm">POPF</A> is used to set TF, a
single-step trap does not occur until after the instruction that follows
<A HREF="POPF.htm">POPF</A>.
<P>
The processor clears the TF bit before invoking the handler.  If TF=1 in
the flags image of a TSS at the time of a task switch, the exception occurs
after the first instruction is executed in the new task.
<P>
The single-step flag is normally not cleared by privilege changes inside a
task.  
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> instructions, however, do clear TF.  
Therefore, software
debuggers that single-step code must recognize and emulate 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT n</A> or 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INTO</A>
rather than executing them directly.
<P>
To maintain protection, system software should check the current execution
privilege level after any single step interrupt to see whether single
stepping should continue at the current privilege level.
<P>
The interrupt priorities in hardware guarantee that if an external
interrupt occurs, single stepping stops. When both an external interrupt and
a single step interrupt occur together, the single step interrupt is
processed first. This clears the TF bit. After saving the return address or
switching tasks, the external interrupt input is examined before the first
instruction of the single step handler executes.  If the external interrupt
is still pending, it is then serviced. The external interrupt handler is not
single-stepped. To single step an interrupt handler, just single step an 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A>
n instruction that refers to the interrupt handler.

<H3>12.3.1.5  Task Switch Breakpoint</H3>
The debug exception also occurs after a switch to an 80386 task if the
T-bit of the new TSS is set.  The exception occurs after control has passed
to the new task, but before the first instruction of that task is executed.
The exception handler can detect this condition by examining the 
BT bit of
the debug status register DR6.
<P>
Note that if the debug exception handler is a task, the T-bit of its TSS
should not be set. Failure to observe this rule will cause the processor to
enter an infinite loop.

<H2>12.3.2 Interrupt 3 -- Breakpoint Exception</H2>
This exception is caused by execution of the breakpoint instruction 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> 3.
Typically, a debugger prepares a breakpoint by substituting the opcode of
the one-byte breakpoint instruction in place of the first opcode byte of the
instruction to be trapped. When execution of the 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> 3 instruction causes
the exception handler to be invoked, the saved value of ES:EIP points to the
byte following the <A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> 3 instruction.
<P>
With prior generations of processors, this feature is used extensively for
trapping execution of specific instructions. With the 80386, the needs
formerly filled by this feature are more conveniently solved via the debug
registers and interrupt 1.  However, the breakpoint exception is still
useful for debugging debuggers, because the breakpoint exception can vector
to a different exception handler than that used by the debugger. The
breakpoint exception can also be useful when it is necessary to set a
greater number of breakpoints than permitted by the debug registers.
