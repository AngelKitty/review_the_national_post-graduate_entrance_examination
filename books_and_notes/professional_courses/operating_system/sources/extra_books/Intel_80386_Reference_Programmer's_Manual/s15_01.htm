<H1>15.1  Executing 8086 Code</H1>
The processor executes in V86 mode when the VM (virtual machine) bit in the
EFLAGS register is set. The processor tests this flag under two general
conditions:
<OL>
<LI> When loading segment registers to know whether to use 8086-style
address formation.
<LI> When decoding instructions to determine which instructions are
sensitive to IOPL.
</OL>
Except for these two modifications to its normal operations, the 80386 in
V86 mode operated much as in protected mode.

<H2>15.1.1  Registers and Instructions</H2>
The register set available in V86 mode includes all the registers defined
for the 8086 plus the new registers introduced by the 80386: FS, GS, debug
registers, control registers, and test registers. New instructions that
explicitly operate on the segment registers FS and GS are available, and the
new segment-override prefixes can be used to cause instructions to utilize
FS and GS for address calculations. Instructions can utilize 32-bit
operands through the use of the operand size prefix.
<P>
8086 programs running as V86 tasks are able to take advantage of the new
applications-oriented instructions added to the architecture by the
introduction of the 80186/80188, 80286 and 80386:
<UL>
<LI> New instructions introduced by 80186/80188 and 80286.
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="PUSH.htm">PUSH</A> immediate data
<LI> Push all and pop all (<A HREF="PUSHA.htm">PUSHA</A> and 
<A HREF="POPA.htm">POPA</A>)
<LI> Multiply immediate data
<LI> Shift and rotate by immediate count
<LI> String I/O
<LI> <A HREF="ENTER.htm">ENTER</A> and 
<A HREF="LEAVE.htm">LEAVE</A>
<LI> <A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A>

<LI> Generalized multiply
</UL>
</UL>

<H2>15.1.2  Linear Address Formation</H2>
In V86 mode, the 80386 processor does not interpret 8086 selectors by
referring to descriptors; instead, it forms linear addresses as an 8086
would. It shifts the selector left by four bits to form a 20-bit base
address. The effective address is extended with four high-order zeros and
added to the base address to create a linear address as 
<A HREF="s15_01.htm#fig15-1">Figure 15-1</A>
illustrates.
<P>
Because of the possibility of a carry, the resulting linear address may
contain up to 21 significant bits. An 8086 program may generate linear
addresses anywhere in the range 0 to 10FFEFH (one megabyte plus
approximately 64 Kbytes) of the task's linear address space.
<P>
V86 tasks generate 32-bit linear addresses. While an 8086 program can only
utilize the low-order 21 bits of a linear address, the linear address can be
mapped via page tables to any 32-bit physical address.
<P>
Unlike the 8086 and 80286, 32-bit effective addresses can be generated (via
the address-size prefix); however, the value of a 32-bit address may not
exceed 65,535 without causing an exception. For full compatibility with
80286 real-address mode, pseudo-protection faults (interrupt 12 or 13 with
no error code) occur if an address is generated outside the range 0 through
65,535.
