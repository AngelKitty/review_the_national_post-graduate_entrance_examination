<H2>Description</H2>

RET transfers control to a return address located on the stack. The
address is usually placed on the stack by a 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction, and the
return is made to the instruction that follows the 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>.
<P>
The optional numeric parameter to RET gives the number of stack bytes
(OperandMode=16) or words (OperandMode=32) to be released after the return
address is popped. These items are typically used as input parameters to the
procedure called.
<P>
For the intrasegment (near) return, the address on the stack is a segment
offset, which is popped into the instruction pointer. The CS register is
unchanged. For the intersegment (far) return, the address on the stack
is a long pointer. The offset is popped first, followed by the selector.
<P>
In real mode, CS and IP are loaded directly. In Protected Mode, an
intersegment return causes the processor to check the descriptor
addressed by the return selector. The AR byte of the descriptor must
indicate a code segment of equal or lesser privilege (or greater or equal
numeric value) than the current privilege level. Returns to a lesser
privilege level cause the stack to be reloaded from the value saved beyond
the parameter block.
<P>
The DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers can be set to 0 by the RET
instruction during an interlevel transfer. If these registers refer to
segments that cannot be used by the new privilege level, they are set to
0 to prevent unauthorized access from the new privilege level.

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

None

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP, #NP, or #SS, as described under "<H2>Operation</H2>" above; #PF(fault-code) for
a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would be outside the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
