<H2>Description</H2>

CMPS compares the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to by the source-index
register with the byte, word, or doubleword pointed to by the
destination-index register.
<P>
If the address-size attribute of this instruction is 16 bits, SI and DI
will be used for source- and destination-index registers; otherwise ESI and
EDI will be used. Load the correct index values into SI and DI (or ESI and
EDI) before executing CMPS.
<P>
The comparison is done by subtracting the operand indexed by
the destination-index register from the operand indexed by the source-index
register.
<P>
Note that the direction of subtraction for CMPS is [SI] - [DI] or
[ESI] - [EDI]. The left operand (SI or ESI) is the source and the right
operand (DI or EDI) is the destination. This is the reverse of the usual
Intel convention in which the left operand is the destination and the right
operand is the source.
<P>
The result of the subtraction is not stored; only the flags reflect the
change. The types of the operands determine whether bytes, words, or
doublewords are compared. For the first operand (SI or ESI), the DS register
is used, unless a segment override byte is present. The second operand (DI
or EDI) must be addressable from the ES register; no segment override is
possible.
<P>
After the comparison is made, both the source-index register and
destination-index register are automatically advanced. If the direction flag
is 0 (<A HREF="CLD.htm">CLD</A> was executed), the registers increment; if the direction flag is 1
(<A HREF="STD.htm">STD</A> was executed), 
the registers decrement. The registers increment or
decrement by 1 if a byte is compared, by 2 if a word is compared, or by 4 if
a doubleword is compared.
<P>
CMPSB, CMPSW and CMPSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and
doubleword CMPS instructions, respectively.
<P>
CMPS can be preceded by the 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REPE</A> or <A HREF="REP.htm">REPNE</A> 
prefix for block comparison of CX
or ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. Refer to the description of the 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A>
instruction for more information on this operation.

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF as described in <A HREF="appc.htm">Appendix C</A>

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES,
FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF (fault-code) for a page fault
