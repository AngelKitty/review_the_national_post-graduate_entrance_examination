<H1>3.5  Control Transfer Instructions</H1>
The 80386 provides both conditional and unconditional control transfer
instructions to direct the flow of execution. Conditional control transfers
depend on the results of operations that affect the flag register.
Unconditional control transfers are always executed.

<H2>3.5.1  Unconditional Transfer Instructions</H2>
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>, 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A>, 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> and 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instructions transfer control from one code
segment location to another. These locations can be within the same code
segment (near control transfers) or in different code segments (far control
transfers). The variants of these instructions that transfer control to
other segments are discussed in a later section of this chapter. If the
model of memory organization used in a particular 80386 application does
not make segments visible to applications programmers, intersegment control
transfers will not be used.

<H3>3.5.1.1  Jump Instruction</H3>
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> (Jump) 
unconditionally transfers control to the target location. 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> is
a one-way transfer of execution; it does not save a return address on the
stack.
<P>
The <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> 
instruction always performs the same basic function of transferring
control from the current location to a new location. Its implementation
varies depending on whether the address is specified directly within the
instruction or indirectly through a register or memory.
<P>
A direct <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> 
instruction includes the destination address as part of the
instruction. An indirect 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instruction obtains the destination address
indirectly through a register or a pointer variable.
<P>
Direct near 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>. A direct 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> uses a relative displacement value contained
in the instruction. The displacement is signed and the size of the
displacement may be a byte, word, or doubleword. The processor forms an
effective address by adding this relative displacement to the address
contained in EIP. When the additions have been performed, EIP refers to the
next instruction to be executed.
<P>
Indirect near 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>. Indirect 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instructions specify an absolute address in
one of several ways:
<OL>
<LI> The program can 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> to a location specified by a general register
(any of EAX, EDX, ECX, EBX, EBP, ESI, or EDI). The processor moves
this 32-bit value into EIP and resumes execution.

<LI> The processor can obtain the destination address from a memory
operand specified in the instruction.

<LI> A register can modify the address of the memory pointer to select a
destination address.
</OL>

<H3>3.5.1.2  Call Instruction</H3>
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> (Call Procedure) 
activates an out-of-line procedure, saving on the
stack the address of the instruction following the 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> for later use by a
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> (Return) instruction. 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> places the current value of EIP on the stack.
The <A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction in the called procedure uses this address to transfer
control back to the calling program.
<P>
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instructions, like 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instructions have relative, direct, and
indirect versions.
<P>
Indirect <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> 
instructions specify an absolute address in one of these ways:
<OL>
<LI> The program can 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> a location specified by a general register (any
of EAX, EDX, ECX, EBX, EBP, ESI, or EDI). The processor moves this
32-bit value into EIP.
<LI> The processor can obtain the destination address from a memory
operand specified in the instruction.
</OL>

<H3>3.5.1.3  Return and Return-From-Interrupt Instruction</H3>
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> (Return From Procedure) 
terminates the execution of a procedure and
transfers control through a back-link on the stack to the program that
originally invoked the procedure. 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> restores the value of EIP that was
saved on the stack by the previous <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction.
<P>
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instructions may optionally 
specify an immediate operand. By adding
this constant to the new top-of-stack pointer, 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> effectively removes any
arguments that the calling program pushed on the stack before the execution
of the <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction.
<P>
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> (Return From Interrupt) 
returns control to an interrupted procedure.
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> differs from 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> in that it also pops the flags from the stack into the
flags register. The flags are stored on the stack by the interrupt
mechanism.

<H2>3.5.2  Conditional Transfer Instructions</H2>
The conditional transfer instructions are jumps that may or may not
transfer control, depending on the state of the CPU flags when the
instruction executes.

<H3>3.5.2.1  Conditional Jump Instructions</H3>
Table 3-2 shows the conditional transfer mnemonics and their
interpretations. The conditional jumps that are listed as pairs are actually
the same instruction. The assembler provides the alternate mnemonics for
greater clarity within a program listing.
<P>
Conditional jump instructions contain a displacement which is added to the
EIP register if the condition is true. The displacement may be a byte, a
word, or a doubleword. The displacement is signed; therefore, it can be used
to jump forward or backward.

<H3>3.5.2.2  Loop Instructions</H3>
The loop instructions are conditional jumps that use a value placed in ECX
to specify the number of repetitions of a software loop. All loop
instructions automatically decrement ECX and terminate the loop when ECX=0.
Four of the five loop instructions specify a condition involving ZF that
terminates the loop before ECX reaches zero.
<P>
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> (Loop While ECX Not Zero) 
is a conditional transfer that automatically
decrements the ECX register before testing ECX for the branch condition. If
ECX is non-zero, the program branches to the target label specified in the
instruction. The 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instruction causes the repetition of a code section
until the operation of the 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instruction decrements ECX to a value of
zero. If 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> finds ECX=0, 
control transfers to the instruction immediately
following the 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instruction. 
If the value of ECX is initially zero, then
the <A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> executes 2^(32) times.
<P>
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPE</A> (Loop While Equal) and 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPZ</A> (Loop While Zero) are synonyms for the
same instruction. These instructions automatically decrement the ECX
register before testing ECX and ZF for the branch conditions. If ECX is
non-zero and ZF=1, the program branches to the target label specified in the
instruction. If 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPE</A> or 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPZ</A> finds that ECX=0 or ZF=0, control transfers
to the instruction immediately following the 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPE</A> or
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPZ</A> instruction.
<P>
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNE</A> (Loop While Not Equal) and 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNZ</A> (Loop While Not Zero) are synonyms
for the same instruction. These instructions automatically decrement the ECX
register before testing ECX and ZF for the branch conditions. If ECX is
non-zero and ZF=0, the program branches to the target label specified in the
instruction. If 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNE</A> or 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNZ</A> finds that ECX=0 or ZF=1, control transfers
to the instruction immediately following the 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNE</A> or 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/LOOPcond.htm">LOOPNZ</A> instruction.

<H3>3.5.2.3  Executing a Loop or Repeat Zero Times</H3>
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A> (Jump if ECX Zero) 
branches to the label specified in the instruction
if it finds a value of zero in ECX. 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A> is useful in combination with the
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instruction and with the string 
scan and compare instructions, all of
which decrement ECX. Sometimes, it is desirable to design a loop that
executes zero times if the count variable in ECX is initialized to zero.
Because the 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instructions (and repeat prefixes) 
decrement ECX before
they test it, a loop will execute 2^(32) times if the program enters the
loop with a zero value in ECX. A programmer may conveniently overcome this
problem with 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A>, which enables the program to branch around the code
within the loop if ECX is zero when 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A> executes. When used with repeated
string scan and compare instructions, 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A> can determine whether the
repetitions terminated due to zero in ECX or due to satisfaction of the
scan or compare conditions.

<H2>3.5.3  Software-Generated Interrupts</H2>
The 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT n</A>, 
<A HREF="INT.htm"INTO</A>, and 
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> instructions allow the programmer to specify a
transfer to an interrupt service routine from within a program.
<P>
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT n</A> (Software Interrupt) 
activates the interrupt service routine that
corresponds to the number coded within the instruction. The 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> instruction
may specify any interrupt type. Programmers may use this flexibility to
implement multiple types of internal interrupts or to test the operation of
interrupt service routines. (Interrupts 0-31 are reserved by Intel.) The
interrupt service routine terminates with an 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instruction that returns
control to the instruction that follows <A HREF="INT.htm">INT n</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="INT.htm">INTO</A> (Interrupt on Overflow) 
invokes interrupt 4 if OF is set. Interrupt 4
is reserved for this purpose. OF is set by several arithmetic, logical, and
string instructions.
<P>
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> (Detect Value Out of Range) 
verifies that the signed value contained
in the specified register lies within specified limits. An interrupt 
(<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A> 5)
occurs if the value contained in the register is less than the lower bound
or greater than the upper bound.
<P>
The <A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> instruction includes two operands. 
The first operand specifies
the register being tested. The second operand contains the effective
relative address of the two signed 
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> limit values. The 
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> instruction
assumes that the upper limit and lower limit are in adjacent memory
locations. These limit values cannot be register operands; if they are, an
invalid opcode exception occurs.
<P>
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> is useful for checking array 
bounds before using a new index value to
access an element within the array. 
<A HREF="BOUND.htm">BOUND</A> provides a simple way to check the
value of an index register before the program overwrites information in a
location beyond the limit of the array.
<P>
The block of memory that specifies the lower and upper limits of an array
might typically reside just before the array itself. This makes the array
bounds accessible at a constant offset from the beginning of the array.
Because the address of the array will already be present in a register, this
practice avoids extra calculations to obtain the effective address of the
array bounds.
<P>
The upper and lower limit values may each be a word or a doubleword.
