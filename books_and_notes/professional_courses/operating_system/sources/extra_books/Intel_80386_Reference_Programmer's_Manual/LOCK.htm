<H1>LOCK -- Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix</H1>

<PRE>
Opcode  Instruction  Clocks  Description

F0      LOCK         0       Assert LOCK# signal for the next instruction
</PRE>

<H2>Description</H2>

The LOCK prefix causes the LOCK# signal of the 80386 to be asserted
during execution of the instruction that follows it. In a multiprocessor
environment, this signal can be used to ensure that the 80386 has
exclusive use of any shared memory while LOCK# is asserted. The
read-modify-write sequence typically used to implement test-and-set on the
80386 is the 
<A HREF="BTS.htm">BTS</A> instruction.
<P>
The LOCK prefix functions only with the following instructions:

<PRE>
<A HREF="BT.htm">BT</A>, <A HREF="BTS.htm">BTS</A>, <A HREF="BTR.htm">BTR</A>, <A HREF="BTC.htm">BTC</A>                   mem, reg/imm
<A HREF="XCHG.htm">XCHG</A>                                reg, mem
<A HREF="XCHG.htm">XCHG</A>                                mem, reg
<A HREF="ADD.htm">ADD</A>, <A HREF="OR.htm">OR</A>, <A HREF="ADC.htm">ADC</A>, <A HREF="SBB.htm">SBB</A>, <A HREF="AND.htm">AND</A>, <A HREF="SUB.htm">SUB</A>, <A HREF="XOR.htm">XOR</A>    mem, reg/imm
<A HREF="NOT.htm">NOT</A>, <A HREF="NEG.htm">NEG</A>, <A HREF="INC.htm">INC</A>, <A HREF="DEC.htm">DEC</A>                  mem
</PRE>

An undefined opcode trap will be generated if a LOCK prefix is used
with any instruction not listed above.
<P>
<A HREF="XCHG.htm">XCHG</A> always asserts LOCK# regardless of the presence or absence of
the LOCK prefix.
<P>
The integrity of the LOCK is not affected by the alignment of the
memory field. Memory locking is observed for arbitrarily misaligned
fields.
<P>
Locked access is not assured if another 80386 processor is executing an
instruction concurrently that has one of the following characteristics:
<UL>
 <LI> Is not preceded by a LOCK prefix

 <LI> Is not one of the instructions in the preceding list

 <LI> Specifies a memory operand that does not exactly overlap the
     destination operand. Locking is not guaranteed for partial overlap,
     even if one memory operand is wholly contained within another.
</UL>

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

None

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#UD if LOCK is used with an instruction not listed in the "Description"
section above; other exceptions can be generated by the subsequent
(locked) instruction

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 6 if LOCK is used with an instruction not listed in the
"Description" section above; exceptions can still be generated by the
subsequent (locked) instruction

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

#UD if LOCK is used with an instruction not listed in the "Description"
section above; exceptions can still be generated by the subsequent (locked)
instruction
