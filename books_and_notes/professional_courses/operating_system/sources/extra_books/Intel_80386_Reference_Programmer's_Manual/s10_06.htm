<H1>10.6  TLB Testing</H1>
The 80386 provides a mechanism for testing the Translation Lookaside Buffer
(TLB), the cache used for translating linear addresses to physical
addresses. Although failure of the TLB hardware is extremely unlikely, users
may wish to include TLB confidence tests among other power-up confidence
tests for the 80386.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<EM>
<H3>Note</H3>
This TLB testing mechanism is unique to the 80386 and may not be
continued in the same way in future processors. Sortware that uses
this mechanism may be incompatible with future processors.
</EM>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
When testing the TLB it is recommended that paging be turned off (PG=0 in
CR0) to avoid interference with the test data being written to the TLB.

<H2>10.6.1  Structure of the TLB</H2>
The TLB is a four-way set-associative memory. 
<A HREF="s10_06.htm#fig10-3">Figure 10-3</A>
  illustrates the
structure of the TLB. There are four sets of eight entries each. Each entry
consists of a tag and data. Tags are 24-bits wide. They contain the
high-order 20 bits of the linear address, the valid bit, and three attribute
bits. The data portion of each entry contains the high-order 20 bits of the
physical address.

<H2>10.6.2  Test Registers</H2>
Two test registers, shown in 
<A HREF="s10_06.htm#fig10-4">Figure 10-4</A>, are provided for the purpose of
testing. TR6 is the test command register, and TR7 is the test data
register. These registers are accessed by variants of the 
<A HREF="MOVRS.htm">MOV</A>
instruction. A test register may be either the source operand or destination
operand. The 
<A HREF="MOVRS.htm">MOV</A> instructions are defined in both 
real-address mode and
protected mode. The test registers are privileged resources; in protected
mode, the 
<A HREF="MOVRS.htm">MOV</A> instructions that access them can only 
be executed at
privilege level 0. An attempt to read or write the test registers when
executing at any other privilege level causes a general
protection exception.
<P>
The test command register (TR6) contains a command and an address tag to
use in performing the command:
<DL>
<DT>
C         
<DD>
This is the command bit. There are two TLB testing commands:
write entries into the TLB, and perform TLB lookups. To cause an
immediate write into the TLB entry, move a doubleword into TR6
that contains a 0 in this bit. To cause an immediate TLB lookup,
move a doubleword into TR6 that contains a 1 in this bit.
<DT>
Linear Address   
<DD>
On a TLB write, a TLB entry is allocated to this linear address;
the rest of that TLB entry is set per the value of TR7 and the
value just written into TR6. On a TLB lookup, the TLB is
interrogated per this value; if one and only one TLB entry
matches, the rest of the fields of TR6 and TR7 are set from the
matching TLB entry.
<DT>
V         
<DD>
The valid bit for this TLB entry. The TLB uses the valid bit to
identify entries that contain valid data. Entries of the TLB
that have not been assigned values have zero in the valid bit.
All valid bits can be cleared by writing to CR3.
<DT>
D, D#     
<DD>
The dirty bit (and its complement) for/from the TLB entry.
<DT>
U, U#     
<DD>
The U/S bit (and its complement) for/from the TLB entry.
<DT>
W, W#     
<DD>
The R/W bit (and its complement) for/from the TLB entry.
<P>
The meaning of these pairs of bits is given by Table 10-1,
where X represents D, U, or W.
</DL>
The test data register (TR7) holds data read from or data to be written to
the TLB.
<DL>
<DT>
Physical Address 
<DD>
This is the data field of the TLB. On a write to the TLB, the
TLB entry allocated to the linear address in TR6 is set to this
value. On a TLB lookup, if HT is set, the data field (physical
address) from the TLB is read out to this field. If HT is not
set, this field is undefined.
<DT>
HT        
<DD>
For a TLB lookup, the HT bit indicates whether the lookup was a
hit (HT := 1) or a miss (HT := 0). For a TLB write, HT must be set
to 1.
<DT>
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A>
<DD>
For a TLB write, selects which of four associative blocks of the
TLB is to be written. For a TLB read, if HT is set, 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A> reports
in which of the four associative blocks the tag was found; if HT
is not set, <A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A> is undefined.
</DL>

<H2>10.6.3  Test Operations</H2>
To write a TLB entry:
<OL>
<LI> Move a doubleword to TR7 that contains the desired physical address,
HT, and <A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A> values. HT must contain 1. 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A> must point to the
associative block in which to place the entry.
<LI> Move a doubleword to TR6 that contains the appropriate linear
address, and values for V, D, U, and W. Be sure C=0 for "write"
command.
</OL>
Be careful not to write duplicate tags; the results of doing so are
undefined.
To look up (read) a TLB entry:
<OL>
<LI> Move a doubleword to TR6 that contains the appropriate linear address
and attributes. Be sure C=1 for "lookup" command.
<LI> Store TR7. If the HT bit in TR7 indicates a hit, then the other
values reveal the TLB contents. If HT indicates a miss, then the other
values in TR7 are indeterminate.
</OL>
For the purposes of testing, the V bit functions as another bit of
addresss.  The V bit for a lookup request should usually be set, so that
uninitialized tags do not match. Lookups with V=0 are unpredictable if any
tags are uninitialized.
