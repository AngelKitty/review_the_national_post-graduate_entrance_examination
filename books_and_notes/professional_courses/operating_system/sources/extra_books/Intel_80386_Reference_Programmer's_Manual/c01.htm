<H1>Chapter 1 -- Introduction to the 80386</H1>
<P>
The 80386 is an advanced 32-bit microprocessor optimized for multitasking
operating systems and designed for applications needing very high
performance. The 32-bit registers and data paths support 32-bit addresses
and data types. The processor can address up to four gigabytes of physical
memory and 64 terabytes (2^(46) bytes) of virtual memory. The on-chip
memory-management facilities include address translation registers,
advanced multitasking hardware, a protection mechanism, and paged virtual
memory. Special debugging registers provide data and code breakpoints even
in ROM-based software.
