<H1>6.3  Segment-Level Protection</H1>
All five aspects of protection apply to segment translation:
<OL>
<LI> Type checking
<LI> Limit checking
<LI> Restriction of addressable domain
<LI> Restriction of procedure entry points
<LI> Restriction of instruction set
</OL>
The segment is the unit of protection, and segment descriptors store
protection parameters. Protection checks are performed automatically by the
CPU when the selector of a segment descriptor is loaded into a segment
register and with every segment access. Segment registers hold the
protection parameters of the currently addressable segments.

<H2>6.3.1  Descriptors Store Protection Parameters</H2>

<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-1">Figure 6-1</A>
  highlights the protection-related fields of segment descriptors.
<P>
The protection parameters are placed in the descriptor by systems software
at the time a descriptor is created. In general, applications programmers do
not need to be concerned about protection parameters.
<P>
When a program loads a selector into a segment register, the processor
loads not only the base address of the segment but also protection
information. Each segment register has bits in the invisible portion for
storing base, limit, type, and privilege level; therefore, subsequent
protection checks on the same segment do not consume additional clock
cycles.

<H3>6.3.1.1  Type Checking</H3>
The TYPE field of a descriptor has two functions:
<OL>
<LI> It distinguishes among different descriptor formats.
<LI> It specifies the intended usage of a segment.
</OL>
Besides the descriptors for data and executable segments commonly used by
applications programs, the 80386 has descriptors for special segments used
by the operating system and for gates. Table 6-1 lists all the types defined
for system segments and gates. Note that not all descriptors define
segments; gate descriptors have a different purpose that is discussed later
in this chapter.
<P>
The type fields of data and executable segment descriptors include bits
which further define the purpose of the segment (refer to 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-1">Figure 6-1</A>
  ):
<UL>
<LI> The writable bit in a data-segment descriptor specifies whether
instructions can write into the segment.
<LI> The readable bit in an executable-segment descriptor specifies
whether instructions are allowed to read from the segment (for example,
to access constants that are stored with instructions). A readable,
executable segment may be read in two ways:
<OL>
<LI> Via the CS register, by using a CS override prefix.

<LI> By loading a selector of the descriptor into a data-segment register
(DS, ES, FS,or GS).
</OL>
</UL>
Type checking can be used to detect programming errors that would attempt
to use segments in ways not intended by the programmer. The processor
examines type information on two kinds of occasions:
<OL>
<LI> When a selector of a descriptor is loaded into a segment register.
Certain segment registers can contain only certain descriptor types;
for example:
<UL>
<LI> The CS register can be loaded only with a selector of an executable
segment.
<LI> Selectors of executable segments that are not readable cannot be
loaded into data-segment registers.
<LI> Only selectors of writable data segments can be loaded into SS.
</UL>
<LI> When an instruction refers (implicitly or explicitly) to a segment
register. Certain segments can be used by instructions only in certain
predefined ways; for example:
<UL>
<LI> No instruction may write into an executable segment.
<LI> No instruction may write into a data segment if the writable bit is
not set.
<LI> No instruction may read an executable segment unless the readable bit
is set.
</UL>
</OL>

<H3>6.3.1.2  Limit Checking</H3>
The limit field of a segment descriptor is used by the processor to prevent
programs from addressing outside the segment. The processor's interpretation
of the limit depends on the setting of the G (granularity) bit. For data
segments, the processor's interpretation of the limit depends also on the
E-bit (expansion-direction bit) and the B-bit (big bit) (refer to Table
6-2).
<P>
When G=0, the actual limit is the value of the 20-bit limit field as it
appears in the descriptor. In this case, the limit may range from 0 to
0FFFFFH (2^(20) - 1 or 1 megabyte). When G=1, the processor appends 12
low-order one-bits to the value in the limit field. In this case the actual
limit may range from 0FFFH (2^(12) - 1 or 4 kilobytes) to 0FFFFFFFFH(2^(32)
- 1 or 4 gigabytes).
<P>
For all types of segments except expand-down data segments, the value of
the limit is one less than the size (expressed in bytes) of the segment. The
processor causes a general-protection exception in any of these cases:
<UL>
<LI> Attempt to access a memory byte at an address > limit.
<LI> Attempt to access a memory word at an address >= limit.
<LI> Attempt to access a memory doubleword at an address >= (limit-2).
</UL>
For expand-down data segments, the limit has the same function but is
interpreted differently.  In these cases the range of valid addresses is from
limit + 1 to either 64K or 2^(32) - 1 (4 Gbytes) depending on the B-bit. An
expand-down segment has maximum size when the limit is zero.
(Turning on the expand-down bit swaps which bytes are accessible
and which are not.)
<P>
The expand-down feature makes it possible to expand the size of a stack by
copying it to a larger segment without needing also to update intrastack
pointers.
<P>
The limit field of descriptors for descriptor tables is used by the
processor to prevent programs from selecting a table entry outside the
descriptor table. The limit of a descriptor table identifies the last valid
byte of the last descriptor in the table. Since each descriptor is eight
bytes long, the limit value is N * 8 - 1 for a table that can contain up to
N descriptors.
<P>
Limit checking catches programming errors such as runaway subscripts and
invalid pointer calculations. Such errors are detected when they occur, so
that identification of the cause is easier. Without limit checking, such
errors could corrupt other modules; the existence of such errors would not
be discovered until later, when the corrupted module behaves incorrectly,
and when identification of the cause is difficult.

<H3>6.3.1.3  Privilege Levels</H3>
The concept of privilege is implemented by assigning a value from zero to
three to key objects recognized by the processor. This value is called the
privilege level. The value zero represents the greatest privilege, the
value three represents the least privilege. The following
processor-recognized objects contain privilege levels:
<UL>
<LI> Descriptors contain a field called the descriptor privilege level
(DPL).
<LI> Selectors contain a field called the requestor's privilege level
(RPL). The RPL is intended to represent the privilege level of
the procedure that originates a selector.
<LI> An internal processor register records the current privilege level
(CPL). Normally the CPL is equal to the DPL of the segment that
the processor is currently executing. CPL changes as control is
transferred to segments with differing DPLs.
</UL>
The processor automatically evaluates the right of a procedure to access
another segment by comparing the CPL to one or more other privilege levels.
The evaluation is performed at the time the selector of a descriptor is
loaded into a segment register. The criteria used for evaluating access to
data differs from that for evaluating transfers of control to executable
segments; therefore, the two types of access are considered separately in
the following sections.
<P>

<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-2">Figure 6-2</A>
  shows how these levels of privilege can be interpreted as rings
of protection. The center is for the segments containing the most critical
software, usually the kernel of the operating system. Outer rings are for
the segments of less critical software.
<P>
It is not necessary to use all four privilege levels. Existing software
that was designed to use only one or two levels of privilege can simply
ignore the other levels offered by the 80386. A one-level system should use
privilege level zero; a two-level system should use privilege levels zero
and three.

<H2>6.3.2  Restricting Access to Data</H2>
To address operands in memory, an 80386 program must load the selector of a
data segment into a data-segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, SS). The
processor automatically evaluates access to a data segment by comparing
privilege levels. The evaluation is performed at the time a selector for the
descriptor of the target segment is loaded into the data-segment register.
As 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-3">Figure 6-3</A>
  shows, three different privilege levels enter into this type
of privilege check:
<OL>
<LI> The CPL (current privilege level).
<LI> The RPL (requestor's privilege level) of the selector used to specify
the target segment.
<LI> The DPL of the descriptor of the target segment.
</OL>
Instructions may load a data-segment register (and subsequently use the
target segment) only if the DPL of the target segment is numerically greater
than or equal to the maximum of the CPL and the selector's RPL. In other
words, a procedure can only access data that is at the same or less
privileged level.
<P>
The addressable domain of a task varies as CPL changes. When CPL is zero,
data segments at all privilege levels are accessible; when CPL is one, only
data segments at privilege levels one through three are accessible; when CPL
is three, only data segments at privilege level three are accessible. This
property of the 80386 can be used, for example, to prevent applications
procedures from reading or changing tables of the operating system.

<H3>6.3.2.1  Accessing Data in Code Segments</H3>
Less common than the use of data segments is the use of code segments to
store data. Code segments may legitimately hold constants; it is not
possible to write to a segment described as a code segment. The following
methods of accessing data in code segments are possible:
<OL>
<LI> Load a data-segment register with a selector of a nonconforming,
readable, executable segment.
<LI> Load a data-segment register with a selector of a conforming,
readable, executable segment.
<LI> Use a CS override prefix to read a readable, executable segment whose
selector is already loaded in the CS register.
</OL>
The same rules as for access to data segments apply to case 1. Case 2 is
always valid because the privilege level of a segment whose conforming bit
is set is effectively the same as CPL regardless of its DPL. Case 3 always
valid because the DPL of the code segment in CS is, by definition, equal to
CPL.

<H2>6.3.3  Restricting Control Transfers</H2>
With the 80386, control transfers are accomplished by the instructions 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>,
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A>, 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A>, and <A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>, 
as well as by the exception and interrupt
mechanisms . Exceptions and interrupts are special cases that 
<A HREF="c09.htm">Chapter 9</A>
covers. This chapter discusses only <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>, 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, and <A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instructions.
<P>
The "near" forms of <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>, <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, and 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> transfer within the current code
segment, and therefore are subject only to limit checking. The processor
ensures that the destination of the <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>, 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, or 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction does not
exceed the limit of the current executable segment. This limit is cached in
the CS register; therefore, protection checks for near transfers require no
extra clock cycles.
<P>
The operands of the "far" forms of 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> and 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> refer to other segments;
therefore, the processor performs privilege checking. There are two ways a
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> or 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> can refer to another segment:
<OL>
<LI> The operand selects the descriptor of another executable segment.
<LI> The operand selects a call gate descriptor. This gated form of
transfer is discussed in a later section on call gates.
</OL>
As 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-4">Figure 6-4</A>
  shows, two different privilege levels enter into a privilege
check for a control transfer that does not use a call gate:
<OL>
<LI> The CPL (current privilege level).

<LI> The DPL of the descriptor of the target segment.
</OL>
Normally the CPL is equal to the DPL of the segment that the processor is
currently executing. CPL may, however, be greater than DPL if the conforming
bit is set in the descriptor of the current executable segment. The
processor keeps a record of the CPL cached in the CS register; this value
can be different from the DPL in the descriptor of the code segment.
<P>
The processor permits a 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> or 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> directly to another segment only if one
of the following privilege rules is satisfied:
<UL>
<LI> DPL of the target is equal to CPL.
<LI> The conforming bit of the target code-segment descriptor is set, and
the DPL of the target is less than or equal to CPL.
</UL>
An executable segment whose descriptor has the conforming bit set is called
a conforming segment. The conforming-segment mechanism permits sharing of
procedures that may be called from various privilege levels but should
execute at the privilege level of the calling procedure. Examples of such
procedures include math libraries and some exception handlers. When control
is transferred to a conforming segment, the CPL does not change. This is
the only case when CPL may be unequal to the DPL of the current executable
segment.
<P>
Most code segments are not conforming. The basic rules of privilege above
mean that, for nonconforming segments, control can be transferred without a
gate only to executable segments at the same level of privilege. There is a
need, however, to transfer control to (numerically) smaller privilege
levels; this need is met by the 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction when used with call-gate
descriptors, which are explained in the next section. The 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instruction
may never transfer control to a nonconforming segment whose DPL does not
equal CPL.

<H2>6.3.4  Gate Descriptors Guard Procedure Entry Points</H2>
To provide protection for control transfers among executable segments
at different privilege levels, the 80386 uses gate descriptors. There are
four kinds of gate descriptors:
<UL>
<LI> Call gates
<LI> Trap gates
<LI> Interrupt gates
<LI> Task gates
</UL>
This chapter is concerned only with call gates. Task gates are used for
task switching , and therefore are discussed in 
<A HREF="c07.htm">Chapter 7</A>. 
<A HREF="c09.htm">Chapter 9</A>
explains how trap gates and interrupt gates are used by exceptions and
interrupts. 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-5">Figure 6-5</A>
  illustrates the format of a call gate. A call gate
descriptor may reside in the GDT or in an LDT, but not in the IDT.
A call gate has two primary functions:
<OL>
<LI> To define an entry point of a procedure.
<LI> To specify the privilege level of the entry point.
</OL>
Call gate descriptors are used by call and jump instructions in the same
manner as code segment descriptors. When the hardware recognizes that the
destination selector refers to a gate descriptor, the operation of the
instruction is expanded as determined by the contents of the call gate.
<P>
The selector and offset fields of a gate form a pointer to the entry point
of a procedure. A call gate guarantees that all transitions to another
segment go to a valid entry point, rather than possibly into the middle of a
procedure (or worse, into the middle of an instruction). The far pointer
operand of the control transfer instruction does not point to the segment
and offset of the target instruction; rather, the selector part of the
pointer selects a gate, and the offset is not used. 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-6">Figure 6-6</A>
  illustrates
this style of addressing.
<P>
As 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-7">Figure 6-7</A>
  shows, four different privilege levels are used to check the
validity of a control transfer via a call gate:
<OL>
<LI> The CPL (current privilege level).
<LI> The RPL (requestor's privilege level) of the selector used to specify
the call gate.
<LI> The DPL of the gate descriptor.
<LI> The DPL of the descriptor of the target executable segment.
</OL>
The DPL field of the gate descriptor determines what privilege levels can
use the gate. One code segment can have several procedures that are intended
for use by different privilege levels. For example, an operating system may
have some services that are intended to be used by applications, whereas
others may be intended only for use by other systems software.
<P>
Gates can be used for control transfers to numerically smaller privilege
levels or to the same privilege level (though they are not necessary for
transfers to the same level). Only 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instructions can use gates to
transfer to smaller privilege levels. A gate may be used by a 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>
instruction only to transfer to an executable segment with the same
privilege level or to a conforming segment.
<P>
For a 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instruction to a nonconforming segment, 
both of the following
privilege rules must be satisfied; otherwise, a general protection exception
results.
<PRE>
MAX (CPL,RPL) <= gate DPL
target segment DPL = CPL
</PRE>
For a <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction (or for a 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instruction to a conforming segment),

<P>
<H3>6.3.4.1  Stack Switching</H3>
If the destination code segment of the call gate is at a different
privilege level than the CPL, an interlevel transfer is being requested.
<P>
To maintain system integrity, each privilege level has a separate stack.
These stacks assure sufficient stack space to process calls from less
privileged levels. Without them, a trusted procedure would not work
correctly if the calling procedure did not provide sufficient space on the
caller's stack.
<P>
The processor locates these stacks via the task state segment (see 
<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-8">Figure 6-8</A>). 
Each task has a separate TSS, thereby permitting tasks to have
separate stacks. Systems software is responsible for creating TSSs and
placing correct stack pointers in them. The initial stack pointers in the
TSS are strictly read-only values. The processor never changes them during
the course of execution.
<P>
When a call gate is used to change privilege levels, a new stack is
selected by loading a pointer value from the Task State Segment (TSS). The
processor uses the DPL of the target code segment (the new CPL) to index the
initial stack pointer for PL 0, PL 1, or PL 2.
<P>
The DPL of the new stack data segment must equal the new CPL; if it does
not, a stack exception occurs. It is the responsibility of systems software
to create stacks and stack-segment descriptors for all privilege levels that
are used. Each stack must contain enough space to hold the old SS:ESP, the
return address, and all parameters and local variables that may be required
to process a call.
<P>
As with intralevel calls, parameters for the subroutine are placed on the
stack. To make privilege transitions transparent to the called procedure,
the processor copies the parameters to the new stack. The count field of a
call gate tells the processor how many doublewords (up to 31) to copy from
the caller's stack to the new stack. If the count is zero, no parameters are
copied.
<P>
The processor performs the following stack-related steps in executing an
interlevel <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>.
<OL>
<LI> The new stack is checked to assure that it is large enough to hold
the parameters and linkages; if it is not, a stack fault occurs with
an error code of 0.
<LI> The old value of the stack registers SS:ESP is pushed onto the new
stack as two doublewords.
<LI> The parameters are copied.
<LI> A pointer to the instruction after the 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction (the former
value of CS:EIP) is pushed onto the new stack. The final value of
SS:ESP points to this return pointer on the new stack.
</OL>

<A HREF="s06_03.htm#fig6-9">Figure 6-9</A>
  illustrates the stack contents after a successful interlevel
call.
<P>
The TSS does not have a stack pointer for a privilege level 3 stack,
because privilege level 3 cannot be called by any procedure at any other
privilege level.
<P>
Procedures that may be called from another privilege level and that require
more than the 31 doublewords for parameters must use the saved SS:ESP link
to access all parameters beyond the last doubleword copied.
<P>
A call via a call gate does not check the values of the words copied onto
the new stack. The called procedure should check each parameter for
validity. A later section discusses how the <A HREF="ARPL.htm">ARPL</A>, 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A>, 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERW</A>, 
<A HREF="LSL.htm">LSL</A>, and 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A>
instructions can be used to check pointer values.

<P>
<H3>6.3.4.2  Returning from a Procedure</H3>
The "near" forms of the 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction transfer control within the current
code segment and therefore are subject only to limit checking. The offset of
the instruction following the corresponding 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, is popped from the stack.
The processor ensures that this offset does not exceed the limit of the
current executable segment.
<P>
The "far" form of the 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction pops the return pointer that was
pushed onto the stack by a prior far 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction. Under normal
conditions, the return pointer is valid, because of its relation to the
prior <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> or 
<A HREF="INT.htm">INT</A>. 
Nevertheless, the processor performs privilege checking
because of the possibility that the current procedure altered the pointer or
failed to properly maintain the stack. The RPL of the CS selector popped
off the stack by the return instruction identifies the privilege level of
the calling procedure.
<P>
An intersegment return instruction can change privilege levels, but only
toward procedures of lesser privilege. When the 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction encounters a
saved CS value whose RPL is numerically greater than the CPL, an interlevel
return occurs. Such a return follows these steps:
<OL>
<LI> The checks shown in Table 6-3 are made, and CS:EIP and SS:ESP are
loaded with their former values that were saved on the stack.
<LI> The old SS:ESP (from the top of the current stack) value is adjusted
by the number of bytes indicated in the 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A> instruction. The resulting
ESP value is not compared to the limit of the stack segment. If ESP is
beyond the limit, that fact is not recognized until the next stack
operation. (The SS:ESP value of the returning procedure is not
preserved; normally, this value is the same as that contained in the
TSS.)
<LI> The contents of the DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers are checked.
If any of these registers refer to segments whose DPL is greater than
the new CPL (excluding conforming code segments), the segment register
is loaded with the null selector (INDEX = 0, TI = 0). The 
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A>
instruction itself does not signal exceptions in these cases;
however, any subsequent memory reference that attempts to use a
segment register that contains the null selector will cause a general
protection exception. This prevents less privileged code from
accessing more privileged segments using selectors left in the
segment registers by the more privileged procedure.
</OL>

<H2>6.3.5  Some Instructions are Reserved for Operating System</H2>
Instructions that have the power to affect the protection mechanism or to
influence general system performance can only be executed by trusted
procedures. The 80386 has two classes of such instructions:
<OL>
<LI> Privileged instructions -- those used for system control.
<LI> Sensitive instructions -- those used for I/O and I/O related
activities.

<H3>6.3.5.1  Privileged Instructions</H3>
The instructions that affect system data structures can only be executed
when CPL is zero. If the CPU encounters one of these instructions when CPL
is greater than zero, it signals a general protection exception. These
instructions include:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="CLTS.htm">CLTS -- Clear Task-Switched Flag</A>
<LI><A HREF="HLT.htm">HLT -- Halt Processor</A>
<LI><A HREF="LGDT.htm">LGDT -- Load GDL Register</A>
<LI><A HREF="LGDT.htm">LIDT -- Load IDT Register</A>
<LI><A HREF="LLDT.htm">LLDT -- Load LDT Register</A>
<LI><A HREF="LMSW.htm">LMSW -- Load Machine Status Word</A>
<LI><A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR -- Load Task Register</A>

<LI><A HREF="MOVRS.htm">MOV to /from DRn -- Move to Debug Register n</A>
<LI><A HREF="MOVRS.htm">MOV to/from TRn -- Move to Test Register n</A>
</UL>

<H3>6.3.5.2  Sensitive Instructions</H3>
Instructions that deal with I/O need to be restricted but also need to be
executed by procedures executing at privilege levels other than zero. The
mechanisms for restriction of I/O operations are covered in detail in

<A HREF="c08.htm">Chapter 8</A>, "Input/Output".

<H2>6.3.6  Instructions for Pointer Validation</H2>
Pointer validation is an important part of locating programming errors.
Pointer validation is necessary for maintaining isolation between the
privilege levels. Pointer validation consists of the following steps:
<OL>
<LI> Check if the supplier of the pointer is entitled to access the
segment.
<LI> Check if the segment type is appropriate to its intended use.
<LI> Check if the pointer violates the segment limit.
</OL>
Although the 80386 processor automatically performs checks 2 and 3 during
instruction execution, software must assist in performing the first check.
The unprivileged instruction 
<A HREF="ARPL.htm">ARPL</A> is provided for this purpose. Software can
also explicitly perform steps 2 and 3 to check for potential violations
(rather than waiting for an exception). The unprivileged instructions 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A>,
<A HREF="LSL.htm">LSL</A>, 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A>, and 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERW</A> are provided for this purpose.
<P>
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A> (Load Access Rights) is used to verify that a pointer refers to a
segment of the proper privilege level and type. 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A> has one operand
selector for a descriptor whose access rights are to be examined. The
descriptor must be visible at the privilege level which is the maximum of
the CPL and the selector's RPL. If the descriptor is visible, 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A> obtains a
masked form of the second doubleword of the descriptor, masks this value
with 00FxFF00H, stores the result into the specified 32-bit destination
register, and sets the zero flag. (The x indicates that the corresponding
four bits of the stored value are undefined.) Once loaded, the access-rights
bits can be tested. All valid descriptor types can be tested by the 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A>
instruction. If the RPL or CPL is greater than DPL, or if the selector is
outside the table limit, no access-rights value is returned, and the zero
flag is cleared. Conforming code segments may be accessed from any privilege
level.
<P>
<A HREF="LSL.htm">LSL</A> 
(Load Segment Limit) allows software to test the limit of a descriptor.
If the descriptor denoted by the given selector (in memory or a register) is
visible at the CPL, 
<A HREF="LSL.htm">LSL</A> loads the specified 32-bit register with a 32-bit,
byte granular, unscrambled limit that is calculated from fragmented limit
fields and the G-bit of that descriptor. This can only be done for segments
(data, code, task state, and local descriptor tables); gate descriptors are
inaccessible. (Table 6-4 lists in detail which types are valid and which
are not.) Interpreting the limit is a function of the segment type. For
example, downward expandable data segments treat the limit differently than
code segments do. For both 
<A HREF="LAR.htm">LAR</A> and 
<A HREF="LSL.htm">LSL</A>, the zero flag (ZF) is set if the
loading was performed; otherwise, the ZF is cleared.

<H3>6.3.6.1  Descriptor Validation</H3>
The 80386 has two instructions, 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A> and 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERW</A>, which determine whether a
selector points to a segment that can be read or written at the current
privilege level. Neither instruction causes a protection fault if the result
is negative.
<P>
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A> (Verify for Reading) 
verifies a segment for reading and loads ZF with
1 if that segment is readable from the current privilege level. 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A> checks
that:
<UL>
<LI> The selector points to a descriptor within the bounds of the GDT or
LDT.
<LI> It denotes a code or data segment descriptor.
<LI> The segment is readable and of appropriate privilege level.
</UL>
The privilege check for data segments and nonconforming code segments is
that the DPL must be numerically greater than or equal to both the CPL and
the selector's RPL. Conforming segments are not checked for privilege level.
<P>
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERW</A> (Verify for Writing) 
provides the same capability as <A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A> for
verifying writability. Like the 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERR</A> instruction, 
<A HREF="VERR.htm">VERW</A> loads ZF if the
result of the writability check is positive. The instruction checks that the
descriptor is within bounds, is a segment descriptor, is writable, and that
its DPL is numerically greater or equal to both the CPL and the selector's
RPL. Code segments are never writable, conforming or not.

<H3>6.3.6.2  Pointer Integrity and RPL</H3>
The Requestor's Privilege Level (RPL) feature can prevent inappropriate use
of pointers that could corrupt the operation of more privileged code or data
from a less privileged level.
<P>
A common example is a file system procedure, FREAD (file_id, n_bytes,
buffer_ptr). This hypothetical procedure reads data from a file into a
buffer, overwriting whatever is there. Normally, FREAD would be available at
the user level, supplying only pointers to the file system procedures and
data located and operating at a privileged level. Normally, such a procedure
prevents user-level procedures from directly changing the file tables.
However, in the absence of a standard protocol for checking pointer
validity, a user-level procedure could supply a pointer into the file tables
in place of its buffer pointer, causing the FREAD procedure to corrupt them
unwittingly.
<P>
Use of RPL can avoid such problems. The RPL field allows a privilege
attribute to be assigned to a selector. This privilege attribute would
normally indicate the privilege level of the code which generated the
selector. The 80386 processor automatically checks the RPL of any selector
loaded into a segment register to determine whether the RPL allows access.
<P>
To take advantage of the processor's checking of RPL, the called procedure
need only ensure that all selectors passed to it have an RPL at least as
high (numerically) as the original caller's CPL. This action guarantees that
selectors are not more trusted than their supplier. If one of the selectors
is used to access a segment that the caller would not be able to access
directly, i.e., the RPL is numerically greater than the DPL, then a
protection fault will result when that selector is loaded into a segment
register.
<P>
<A HREF="ARPL.htm">ARPL</A> 
(Adjust Requestor's Privilege Level) adjusts the RPL field of a
selector to become the larger of its original value and the value of the RPL
field in a specified register. The latter is normally loaded from the image
of the caller's CS register which is on the stack. If the adjustment changes
the selector's RPL, ZF (the zero flag) is set; otherwise, ZF is cleared.
