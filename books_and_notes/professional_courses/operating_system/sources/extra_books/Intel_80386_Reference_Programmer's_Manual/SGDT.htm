<H1>SGDT/SIDT -- Store Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register</H1>

<PRE>
Opcode       Instruction   Clocks   Description

0F  01 /0    SGDT m        9        Store GDTR to m
0F  01 /1    SIDT m        9        Store IDTR to m
</PRE>

<H2>Operation</H2>

<PRE>
DEST := 48-bit BASE/LIMIT register contents;
</PRE>

<H2>Description</H2>

SGDT/SIDT copies the contents of the descriptor table register the six
bytes of memory indicated by the operand. The LIMIT field of the
register is assigned to the first word at the effective address. If the
operand-size attribute is 32 bits, the next three bytes are assigned the
BASE field of the register, and the fourth byte is written with zero. The
last byte is undefined. Otherwise, if the operand-size attribute is 16
bits, the next four bytes are assigned the 32-bit BASE field of the
register.
<P>
SGDT and SIDT are used only in operating system software; they are
not used in application programs.

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

None

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 6 if the destination operand is a register; #GP(0) if the
destination is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal memory
operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for
an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 6 if the destination operand is a register; Interrupt 13 if any
part of the operand would lie outside of the effective address space from
0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault

<H2>Compatability Note</H2>

The 16-bit forms of the SGDT/SIDT instructions are compatible with
the 80286, if the value in the upper eight bits is not referenced. The
80286 stores 1's in these upper bits, whereas the 80386 stores 0's if the
operand-size attribute is 16 bits. These bits were specified as undefined
by the SGDT/SIDT instructions in the iAPX 286 Programmer's
Reference Manual.
