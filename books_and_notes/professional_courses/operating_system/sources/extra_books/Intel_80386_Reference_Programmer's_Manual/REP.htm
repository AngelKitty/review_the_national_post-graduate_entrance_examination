<H2>Description</H2>

REP, REPE (repeat while equal), and REPNE (repeat while not equal)
are prefix that are applied to string operation. Each prefix cause the
string instruction that follows to be repeated the number of times
indicated in the count register or (for REPE and REPNE) until the
indicated condition in the zero flag is no longer met.
<P>
Synonymous forms of REPE and REPNE are REPZ and REPNZ,
respectively.
<P>
The REP prefixes apply only to one string instruction at a time. To repeat
a block of instructions, use the 
<A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instruction or another looping
construct.
<P>
The precise action for each iteration is as follows:

<OL>
 <LI> If the address-size attribute is 16 bits, use CX for the count
      register; if the address-size attribute is 32 bits, use ECX for the
      count register.

 <LI> Check CX. If it is zero, exit the iteration, and move to the next
      instruction.

 <LI> Acknowledge any pending interrupts.

 <LI> Perform the string operation once.

 <LI> Decrement CX or ECX by one; no flags are modified.

 <LI> Check the zero flag if the string operation is 
<A HREF="SCAS.htm">SCAS</A> or <A HREF="CMPS.htm">CMPS</A>. If
      the repeat condition does not hold, exit the iteration and move to
      the next instruction. Exit the iteration if the prefix is REPE and ZF
      is 0 (the last comparison was not equal), or if the prefix is REPNE
      and ZF is one (the last comparison was equal).

 <LI> Return to step 1 for the next iteration.
</OL>

Repeated 
<A HREF="CMPS.htm">CMPS</A> and <A HREF="SCAS.htm">SCAS</A> 
instructions can be exited if the count is
exhausted or if the zero flag fails the repeat condition. These two cases
can be distinguished by using either the 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JCXZ</A> instruction, or by using
the conditional jumps that test the zero flag (<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JZ</A>, 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JNZ</A>, and 
<A HREF="Jcc.htm">JNE</A>).

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

ZF by REP <A HREF="CMPS.htm">CMPS</A> and REP 
<A HREF="SCAS.htm">SCAS</A> as described above

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#UD if a repeat prefix is used before an instruction that is not in the
list above; further exceptions can be generated when the string operation is
executed; refer to the descriptions of the string instructions themselves

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 6 if a repeat prefix is used before an instruction that is not in
the list above; further exceptions can be generated when the string
operation is executed; refer to the descriptions of the string instructions
themselves

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

#UD if a repeat prefix is used before an instruction that is not in the
list above; further exceptions can be generated when the string operation is
executed; refer to the descriptions of the string instructions themselves

<H2>Notes</H2>

Not all input/output ports can handle the rate at which the REP 
<A HREF="INS.htm">INS</A>
and REP <A HREF="OUTS.htm">OUTS</A> instructions execute.
