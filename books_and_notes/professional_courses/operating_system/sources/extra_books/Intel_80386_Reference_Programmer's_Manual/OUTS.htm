<H2>Description</H2>

OUTS transfers data from the memory byte, word, or doubleword at the
source-index register to the output port addressed by the DX register. If
the address-size attribute for this instruction is 16 bits, SI is used for
the source-index register; otherwise, the address-size attribute is 32 bits,
and ESI is used for the source-index register.
<P>
OUTS does not allow specification of the port number as an immediate value.
The port must be addressed through the DX register value. Load the correct
value into DX before executing the OUTS instruction.
<P>
The address of the source data is determined by the contents of
source-index register. Load the correct index value into SI or ESI before
executing the OUTS instruction.
<P>
After the transfer, source-index register is advanced automatically. If
the direction flag is 0 (<A HREF="CLD.htm">CLD</A> 
was executed), the source-index register is
incremented; if the direction flag is 1 (<A HREF="STD.htm">STD</A> was executed), it is
decremented. The amount of the increment or decrement is 1 if a byte is
output, 2 if a word is output, or 4 if a doubleword is output.
<P>
OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD are synonyms for the byte, word, and
doubleword OUTS instructions. OUTS can be preceded by the 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A>
prefix for block output of CX bytes or words. Refer to the 
<A HREF="REP.htm">REP</A>
instruction for details on this operation.

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

None

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP(0) if CPL is greater than IOPL and any of the corresponding I/O
permission bits in TSS equals 1; #GP(0) for an illegal memory operand
effective address in the CS, DS, or ES segments; #SS(0) for an illegal
address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP(0) fault if any of the corresponding I/O permission bits in TSS
equals 1; #PF(fault-code) for a page fault
