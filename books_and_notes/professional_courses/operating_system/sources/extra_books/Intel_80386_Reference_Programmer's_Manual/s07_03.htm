<H1>7.3  Task Register</H1>
The task register (TR) identifies the currently executing task by pointing
to the TSS. 
<A HREF="s07_03.htm#fig7-3">Figure 7-3</A>
  shows the path by which the processor accesses the
current TSS.
<P>
The task register has both a "visible" portion (i.e., can be read and
changed by instructions) and an "invisible" portion (maintained by the
processor to correspond to the visible portion; cannot be read by any
instruction). The selector in the visible portion selects a TSS descriptor
in the GDT. The processor uses the invisible portion to cache the base and
limit values from the TSS descriptor. Holding the base and limit in a
register makes execution of the task more efficient, because the processor
does not need to repeatedly fetch these values from memory when it
references the TSS of the current task.
<P>
The instructions <A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR</A> and 
<A HREF="STR.htm">STR</A> are used to modify and read the visible
portion of the task register. Both instructions take one operand, a 16-bit
selector located in memory or in a general register.
<P>
<A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR</A> (Load task register) 
loads the visible portion of the task register
with the selector operand, which must select a TSS descriptor in the GDT.
<A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR</A> 
also loads the invisible portion with information from the TSS
descriptor selected by the operand. 
<A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR</A> is a privileged instruction; it may
be executed only when CPL is zero. 
<A HREF="LTR.htm">LTR</A> is generally used during system
initialization to give an initial value to the task register; thereafter,
the contents of TR are changed by task switch operations.
<P>
<A HREF="STR.htm">STR</A> (Store task register) 
stores the visible portion of the task register
in a general register or memory word. 
<A HREF="STR.htm">STR</A> is not privileged.
