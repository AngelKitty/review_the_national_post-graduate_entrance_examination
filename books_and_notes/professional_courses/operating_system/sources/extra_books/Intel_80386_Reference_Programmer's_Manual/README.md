# Intel 80386 Reference Programmer's Manual

This is a copy of the HTML version of the manual found in [6.858 in MIT](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/toc.htm).
You can [read it online](https://nju-projectn.github.io/i386-manual/toc.htm).

Since there are lots of typos in the manaul,
and they sometimes cause misleading or confusion to the readers,
we push the HTML version to github and call for contributions to fix the typos.
