16.1  How the 80386 Implements 16-Bit and 32-Bit Features</A>

<P>
The 80386 running in protected mode is a 32-bit microprocessor, but it is
designed to support 16-bit processing at three levels:
<OL>
<LI>Executing 8086/80286 16-bit programs efficiently with complete 
      compatibility.

<LI>Mixing 16-bit modules with 32-bit modules.

<LI>Mixing 16-bit and 32-bit addresses and operands within one module.
</OL>
The first level of support for 16-bit programs has already been discussed
in <A HREF="c13.htm">Chapter 13</A>, 
<A HREF="c14.htm">Chapter 14</A>, 
and <A HREF="c15.htm">Chapter 15</A>. This chapter shows how 16-bit
and 32-bit modules can cooperate with one another, and how one module can
utilize both 16-bit and 32-bit operands and addressing.
<P>
The 80386 functions most efficiently when it is possible to distinguish
between pure 16-bit modules and pure 32-bit modules. A pure 16-bit module
has these characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>All segments occupy 64 Kilobytes or less.
<LI>Data items are either 8 bits or 16 bits wide.
<LI>Pointers to code and data have 16-bit offsets.
<LI>Control is transferred only among 16-bit segments.
</UL>
A pure 32-bit module has these characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>Segments may occupy more than 64 Kilobytes (zero bytes to 4 
   gigabytes).

<LI>Data items are either 8 bits or 32 bits wide.

<LI>Pointers to code and data have 32-bit offsets.

<LI>Control is transferred only among 32-bit segments.
</UL>
Pure 16-bit modules do exist; they are the modules designed for 16-bit
microprocessors. Pure 32-bit modules may exist in new programs designed
explicitly for the 80386. However, as systems designers move applications
from 16-bit processors to the 32-bit 80386, it will not always be possible
to maintain these ideals of pure 16-bit or 32-bit modules. It may be
expedient to execute old 16-bit modules in a new 32-bit environment without
making source-code changes to the old modules if any of the following
conditions is true:
<UL>
<LI>Modules will be converted one-by-one from 16-bit environments to
     32-bit environments.

<LI>Older, 16-bit compilers and software-development tools will be
     utilized in the new32-bit operating environment until new 32-bit
     versions can be created.

<LI>The source code of 16-bit modules is not available for modification.

<LI>The specific data structures used by a given module inherently utilize
     16-bit words.

<LI>The native word size of the source language is 16 bits.
</UL>
On the 80386, 16-bit modules can be mixed with 32-bit modules. To design a
system that mixes 16- and 32-bit code requires an understanding of the
mechanisms that the 80386 uses to invoke and control its 32-bit and 16-bit
features.
