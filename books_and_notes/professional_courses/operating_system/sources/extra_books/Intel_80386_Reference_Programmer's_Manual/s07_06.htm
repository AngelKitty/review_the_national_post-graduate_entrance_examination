<H1>7.6  Task Linking</H1>
The back-link field of the TSS and the NT (nested task) bit of the flag
word together allow the 80386 to automatically return to a task that 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>ed
another task or was interrupted by another task. When a 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> instruction, an
interrupt instruction, an external interrupt, or an exception causes a
switch to a new task, the 80386 automatically fills the back-link of the new
TSS with the selector of the outgoing task's TSS and, at the same time,
sets the NT bit in the new task's flag register. The NT flag indicates
whether the back-link field is valid. The new task releases control by
executing an <A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A> instruction. When interpreting an 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>, the 80386 examines
the NT flag. If NT is set, the 80386 switches back to the task selected by
the back-link field. Table 7-2 summarizes the uses of these fields.

<H2>7.6.1  Busy Bit Prevents Loops</H2>
The B-bit (busy bit) of the TSS descriptor ensures the integrity of the
back-link. A chain of back-links may grow to any length as interrupt tasks
interrupt other interrupt tasks or as called tasks call other tasks. The
busy bit ensures that the CPU can detect any attempt to create a loop. A
loop would indicate an attempt to reenter a task that is already busy;
however, the TSS is not a reentrable resource.
<P>
The processor uses the busy bit as follows:
<OL>
<LI> When switching to a task, the processor automatically sets the busy
bit of the new task.
<LI> When switching from a task, the processor automatically clears the
busy bit of the old task if that task is not to be placed on the
back-link chain (i.e., the instruction causing the task switch is 
<A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A>
or 
<A HREF="IRET.htm">IRET</A>). 
If the task is placed on the back-link chain, its busy bit
remains set.
<LI> When switching to a task, the processor signals an exception if the
busy bit of the new task is already set.
</OL>
By these actions, the processor prevents a task from switching to itself or
to any task that is on a back-link chain, thereby preventing invalid reentry
into a task.
<P>
The busy bit is effective even in multiprocessor configurations, because
the processor automatically asserts a bus lock when it sets or clears the
busy bit. This action ensures that two processors do not invoke the same
task at the same time . (Refer to 
<A HREF="c11.htm">Chapter 11</A>
   for more on multiprocessing.)

<H2>7.6.2  Modifying Task Linkages</H2>
Any modification of the linkage order of tasks should be accomplished only
by software that can be trusted to correctly update the back-link and the
busy-bit. Such changes may be needed to resume an interrupted task before
the task that interrupted it. Trusted software that removes a task from the
back-link chain must follow one of the following policies:
<OL>
<LI> First change the back-link field in the TSS of the interrupting task,
then clear the busy-bit in the TSS descriptor of the task removed from
the list.
<LI> Ensure that no interrupts occur between updating the back-link chain
and the busy bit.
</OL>
