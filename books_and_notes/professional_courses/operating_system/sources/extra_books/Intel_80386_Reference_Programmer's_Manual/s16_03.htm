<H1>16.3  Sharing Data Segments Among Mixed Code Segments</H1>
Because the choice of operand size and address size is defined in code
segments and their descriptors, data segments can be shared freely among
both USE16 and USE32 code segments. The only limitation is the one imposed
by pointers with 16-bit offsets, which can only point to the first 64
Kilobytes of a segment. When a data segment that contains more than 64
Kilobytes is to be shared among USE32 and USE16 segments, the data that is
to be accessed by the USE16 segments must be located within the first 64
Kilobytes.
<P>
A stack that spans addresses less than 64K can be shared by both USE16 and
USE32 code segments. This class of stacks includes:
<UL>
<LI> Stacks in expand-up segments with G=0 and B=0.
<LI> Stacks in expand-down segments with G=0 and B=0.
<LI> Stacks in expand-up segments with G=1 and B=0, in which the stack is
contained completely within the lower 64 Kilobytes. (Offsets greater
than 64K can be used for data, other than the stack, that is not
shared.)
</UL>
The B-bit of a stack segment cannot, in general, be used to change the size
of stack used by a USE16 code segment. The size of stack pointer used by the
processor for implicit stack references is controlled by the B-bit of the
data-segment descriptor for the stack. Implicit references are those caused
by interrupts, exceptions, and instructions such as 
<A HREF="PUSH.htm">PUSH</A>, 
<A HREF="POP.htm">POP</A>, 
<A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A>, and
<A HREF="RET.htm">RET</A>. 
One might be tempted, therefore, to try to increase beyond 64K the
size of the stack used by 16-bit code simply by supplying a larger stack
segment with the B-bit set. However, the B-bit does not control explicit
stack references, such as accesses to parameters or local variables. A USE16
code segment can utilize a "big" stack only if the code is modified so that
all explicit references to the stack are preceded by the address-size
prefix, causing those references to use 32-bit addressing.
<P>
In big, expand-down segments (B=1, G=1, and E=1), all offsets are greater
than 64K, therefore USE16 code cannot utilize such a stack segment unless
the code segment is modified to employ 32-bit addressing . (Refer to 
<A HREF="c06.htm">Chapter 6</A>
   for a review of the B , G, and E bits .)
