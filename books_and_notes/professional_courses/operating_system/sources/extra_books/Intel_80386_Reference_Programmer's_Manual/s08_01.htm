<H1>8.1  I/O Addressing</H1>
The 80386 allows input/output to be performed in either of two ways:
<UL>
<LI> By means of a separate I/O address space (using specific I/O
instructions)
<LI> By means of memory-mapped I/O (using general-purpose operand
manipulation instructions).
</UL>

<H2>8.1.1  I/O Address Space</H2>
The 80386 provides a separate I/O address space, distinct from physical
memory, that can be used to address the input/output ports that are used for
external 16 devices. The I/O address space consists of 2^(16) (64K)
individually addressable 8-bit ports; any two consecutive 8-bit ports can be
treated as a 16-bit port; and four consecutive 8-bit ports can be treated
as a 32-bit port. Thus, the I/O address space can accommodate up to 64K
8-bit ports, up to 32K 16-bit ports, or up to 16K 32-bit ports.
<P>
The program can specify the address of the port in two ways. Using an
immediate byte constant, the program can specify:
<UL>
<LI> 256 8-bit ports numbered 0 through 255.
<LI> 128 16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 252, 254.
<LI> 64 32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 248, 252.
</UL>
Using a value in DX, the program can specify:
<UL>
<LI> 8-bit ports numbered 0 through 65535
<LI> 16-bit ports numbered 0, 2, 4, . . . , 65532, 65534
<LI> 32-bit ports numbered 0, 4, 8, . . . , 65528, 65532
</UL>
The 80386 can transfer 32, 16, or 8 bits at a time to a device located in
the I/O space. Like doublewords in memory, 32-bit ports should be aligned at
addresses evenly divisible by four so that the 32 bits can be transferred in
a single bus access. Like words in memory, 16-bit ports should be aligned at
even-numbered addresses so that the 16 bits can be transferred in a single
bus access. An 8-bit port may be located at either an even or odd address.
<P>
The instructions <A HREF="IN.htm">IN</A> and 
<A HREF="OUT.htm">OUT</A> move data between a register and a port in the
I/O address space. The instructions <A HREF="INS.htm">INS</A> and 
<A HREF="OUTS.htm">OUTS</A> move strings of data
between the memory address space and ports in the I/O address space.

<H2>8.1.2  Memory-Mapped I/O</H2>
I/O devices also may be placed in the 80386 memory address space. As long
as the devices respond like memory components, they are indistinguishable to
the processor.
<P>
Memory-mapped I/O provides additional programming flexibility. Any
instruction that references memory may be used to access an I/O port located
in the memory space. For example, the <A HREF="MOV.htm">MOV</A> instruction can transfer data
between any register and a port; and the <A HREF="AND.htm">AND</A>, <A HREF="OR.htm">OR</A>, and <A HREF="TEST.htm">TEST</A> instructions may
be used to manipulate bits in the internal registers of a device (see 
<A HREF="s08_02.htm#fig8-1">Figure 8-1</A>
  ). Memory-mapped I/O performed via the full instruction set maintains
the full complement of addressing modes for selecting the desired I/O
device (e.g., direct address, indirect address, base register, index
register, scaling).
<P>
Memory-mapped I/O, like any other memory reference, is subject to access
protection and control when executing in protected mode. Refer to 
<A HREF="c06.htm">Chapter 6</A>
  
for a discussion of memory protection.
