<H1>10.3  Switching to Protected Mode</H1>
Setting the PE bit of the MSW in CR0 causes the 80386 to begin executing in
protected mode. The current privilege level (CPL) starts at zero. The
segment registers continue to point to the same linear addresses as in real
address mode (in real address mode, linear addresses are the same physical
addresses).
<P>
Immediately after setting the PE flag, the initialization code must flush
the processor's instruction prefetch queue by executing a <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> instruction.
The 80386 fetches and decodes instructions and addresses before they are
used; however, after a change into protected mode, the prefetched
instruction information (which pertains to real-address mode) is no longer
valid. A <A HREF="JMP.htm">JMP</A> forces the processor to discard the invalid information.
