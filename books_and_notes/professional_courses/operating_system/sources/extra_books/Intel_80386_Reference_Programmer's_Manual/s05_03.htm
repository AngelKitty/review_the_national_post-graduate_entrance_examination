<H1>5.3  Combining Segment and Page Translation</H1>

<A HREF="s05_03.htm#fig5-12">Figure 5-12</A>
  combines
<A HREF="s05_01.htm#fig5-2">Figure 5-2</A>
  and
<A HREF="s05_02.htm#fig5-9">Figure 5-9</A>
  to summarize both phases
of the transformation from a logical address to a physical address when
paging is enabled. By appropriate choice of options and parameters to both
phases, memory-management software can implement several different styles of
memory management.

<H2>5.3.1  "Flat" Architecture</H2>
When the 80386 is used to execute software designed for architectures that
don't have segments, it may be expedient to effectively "turn off" the
segmentation features of the 80386. The 80386 does not have a mode that
disables segmentation, but the same effect can be achieved by initially
loading the segment registers with selectors for descriptors that encompass
the entire 32-bit linear address space. Once loaded, the segment registers
don't need to be changed. The 32-bit offsets used by 80386 instructions are
adequate to address the entire linear-address space.

<H2>5.3.2  Segments Spanning Several Pages</H2>
The architecture of the 80386 permits segments to be larger or smaller than
the size of a page (4 Kilobytes). For example, suppose a segment is used to
address and protect a large data structure that spans 132 Kilobytes. In a
software system that supports paged virtual memory, it is not necessary for
the entire structure to be in physical memory at once. The structure is
divided into 33 pages, any number of which may not be present. The
applications programmer does not need to be aware that the virtual memory
subsystem is paging the structure in this manner.

<H2>5.3.3  Pages Spanning Several Segments</H2>
On the other hand, segments may be smaller than the size of a page. For
example, consider a small data structure such as a semaphore. Because of the
protection and sharing provided by segments (refer to 
<A HREF="c06.htm">Chapter 6</A>
   ) , it may be
useful to create a separate segment for each semaphore. But, because a
system may need many semaphores, it is not efficient to allocate a page for
each. Therefore, it may be useful to cluster many related segments within a
page.

<H2>5.3.4  Non-Aligned Page and Segment Boundaries</H2>
The architecture of the 80386 does not enforce any correspondence between
the boundaries of pages and segments. It is perfectly permissible for a page
to contain the end of one segment and the beginning of another. Likewise, a
segment may contain the end of one page and the beginning of another.

<H2>5.3.5  Aligned Page and Segment Boundaries</H2>
Memory-management software may be simpler, however, if it enforces some
correspondence between page and segment boundaries. For example, if segments
are allocated only in units of one page, the logic for segment and page
allocation can be combined. There is no need for logic to account for
partially used pages.

<H2>5.3.6  Page-Table per Segment</H2>
An approach to space management that provides even further simplification
of space-management software is to maintain a one-to-one correspondence
between segment descriptors and page-directory entries, as 
<A HREF="s05_03.htm#fig5-13">Figure 5-13</A>
 
illustrates. Each descriptor has a base address in which the low-order 22
bits are zero; in other words, the base address is mapped by the first entry
of a page table. A segment may have any limit from 1 to 4 megabytes.
Depending on the limit, the segment is contained in from 1 to 1K page
frames. A task is thus limited to 1K segments (a sufficient number for many
applications), each containing up to 4 Mbytes. The descriptor, the
corresponding page-directory entry, and the corresponding page table can be
allocated and deallocated simultaneously.
