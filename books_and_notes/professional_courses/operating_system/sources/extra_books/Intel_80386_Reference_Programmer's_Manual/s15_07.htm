<H1>15.7  Differences From 80286 Real-Address Mode</H1>
The 80286 processor implements the bus lock function differently than the
80386. This fact may or may not be apparent to 8086 programs, depending on
how the V86 monitor handles the <A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A> prefix. 
<A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A>ed instructions are
sensitive to IOPL; therefore, software designers can choose to emulate its
function. If, however, 8086 programs are allowed to execute 
<A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A> directly,
programs that use forms of memory locking specific to the 8086 may not
execute properly when transported to a specific application of the 80386.
<P>
The <A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A> 
prefix and its corresponding output signal should only be used to
prevent other bus masters from interrupting a data movement operation. 
<A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A>
may only be used with the following 80386 instructions when they modify
memory. An undefined-opcode exception results from using 
<A HREF="LOCK.htm">LOCK</A> before any
other instruction.

<A HREF="INC.htm">INC</A>, 
<A HREF="DEC.htm">DEC</A>, 
<A HREF="NOT.htm">NOT</A>, and 
<A HREF="NEG.htm">NEG</A>.
<LI> Two-operand arithmetic and logical: 
<A HREF="ADD.htm">ADD</A>, 
<A HREF="ADC.htm">ADC</A>, 
<A HREF="SUB.htm">SUB</A>, 
<A HREF="SBB.htm">SBB</A>, 
<A HREF="AND.htm">AND</A>, 
<A HREF="OR.htm">OR</A>, 
<A HREF="XOR.htm">XOR</A>.

A locked instruction is guaranteed to lock only the area of memory defined
by the destination operand, but may lock a larger memory area. For example,
typical 8086 and 80286 configurations lock the entire physical memory space.
With the 80386, the defined area of memory is guaranteed to be locked
against access by a processor executing a locked instruction on exactly the
same memory area, i.e., an operand with identical starting address and
identical length.
