<H1>7.2  TSS Descriptor</H1>
The task state segment, like all other segments, is defined by a
descriptor. 
<A HREF="s07_02.htm#fig7-2">Figure 7-2</A>
  shows the format of a TSS descriptor.
<P>
The B-bit in the type field indicates whether the task is busy. A type code
of 9 indicates a non-busy task; a type code of 11 indicates a busy task.
Tasks are not reentrant. The B-bit allows the processor to detect an attempt
to switch to a task that is already busy.
<P>
The BASE, LIMIT, and DPL fields and the G-bit and P-bit have functions
similar to their counterparts in data-segment descriptors. The LIMIT field,
however, must have a value equal to or greater than 103. An attempt to
switch to a task whose TSS descriptor has a limit less that 103 causes an
exception. A larger limit is permissible, and a larger limit is required if
an I/O permission map is present. A larger limit may also be convenient for
systems software if additional data is stored in the same segment as the
TSS.
<P>
A procedure that has access to a TSS descriptor can cause a task switch. In
most systems the DPL fields of TSS descriptors should be set to zero, so
that only trusted software has the right to perform task switching.
<P>
Having access to a TSS-descriptor does not give a procedure the right to
read or modify a TSS. Reading and modification can be accomplished only with
another descriptor that redefines the TSS as a data segment. An attempt to
load a TSS descriptor into any of the segment registers (CS, SS, DS, ES, FS,
GS) causes an exception.
<P>
TSS descriptors may reside only in the GDT. An attempt to identify a TSS
with a selector that has TI=1 (indicating the current LDT) results in an
exception.
