Not the same division as 
<A HREF="IDIV.htm">IDIV</A>; rounding is toward negative infinity.

<H2>Description</H2>

SAL (or its synonym, SHL) shifts the bits of the operand upward. The
high-order bit is shifted into the carry flag, and the low-order bit is set
to 0.
<P>
SAR and SHR shift the bits of the operand downward. The low-order
bit is shifted into the carry flag. The effect is to divide the operand by
2. SAR performs a signed divide with rounding toward negative infinity (not
the same as 
<A HREF="IDIV.htm">IDIV</A>); 
the high-order bit remains the same. SHR performs an
unsigned divide; the high-order bit is set to 0.
<P>
The shift is repeated the number of times indicated by the second
operand, which is either an immediate number or the contents of the CL
register. To reduce the maximum execution time, the 80386 does not
allow shift counts greater than 31. If a shift count greater than 31 is
attempted, only the bottom five bits of the shift count are used. (The
8086 uses all eight bits of the shift count.)
<P>
The overflow flag is set only if the single-shift forms of the instructions
are used. For left shifts, OF is set to 0 if the high bit of the answer is
the same as the result of the carry flag (i.e., the top two bits of the
original operand were the same); OF is set to 1 if they are different. For
SAR, OF is set to 0 for all single shifts. For SHR, OF is set to the
high-order bit of the original operand.

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

OF for single shifts; OF is undefined for multiple shifts; CF, ZF, PF,
and SF as described in <A HREF="appc.htm">Appendix C</A>

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP(0) if the result is in a nonwritable segment; #GP(0) for an illegal
memory operand effective address in the CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment; #PF(fault-code)
for a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
