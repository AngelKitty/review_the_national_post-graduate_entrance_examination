<H1>MUL -- Unsigned Multiplication of AL or AX</H1>

<PRE>
Opcode  Instruction     Clocks       Description

F6  /4  MUL AL,r/m8     9-14/12-17   Unsigned multiply (AX := AL * r/m byte)
F7  /4  MUL AX,r/m16    9-22/12-25   Unsigned multiply (DX:AX := AX * r/m
                                     word)
F7  /4  MUL EAX,r/m32   9-38/12-41   Unsigned multiply (EDX:EAX := EAX * r/m
                                     dword)

<H3>Notes</H3>
  The 80386 uses an early-out multiply algorithm. The actual number of
  clocks depends on the position of the most significant bit in the 
  optimizing multiplier, shown underlined above. The optimization occurs
  for positive and negative multiplier values. Because of the early-out
  algorithm, clock counts given are minimum to maximum. To calculate the
  actual clocks, use the following formula:
<PRE>
    Actual clock = if  <> 0 then max(ceiling(log{2}(m)), 3) + 6 clocks;

    Actual clock = if  = 0 then 9 clocks
</PRE>
  where <TT>m</TT> is the multiplier.

<H2>Operation</H2>

<PRE>
IF byte-size operation
THEN AX := AL * r/m8
ELSE (* word or doubleword operation *)
   IF OperandSize = 16
   THEN DX:AX := AX * r/m16
   ELSE (* OperandSize = 32 *)
      EDX:EAX := EAX * r/m32
   FI;
FI;
</PRE>

<H2>Description</H2>

MUL performs unsigned multiplication. Its actions depend on the size
of its operand, as follows:
<UL>
 <LI> A byte operand is multiplied by AL; the result is left in AX. The
     carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if AH is 0; otherwise, they are
     set to 1.

 <LI> A word operand is multiplied by AX; the result is left in DX:AX.
     DX contains the high-order 16 bits of the product. The carry and
     overflow flags are set to 0 if DX is 0; otherwise, they are set to 1.

 <LI> A doubleword operand is multiplied by EAX and the result is left in
     EDX:EAX. EDX contains the high-order 32 bits of the product. The
     carry and overflow flags are set to 0 if EDX is 0; otherwise, they are
     set to 1.
</UL>

<H2>Flags Affected</H2>

OF and CF as described above; SF, ZF, AF and PF are undefined

<H2>Protected Mode Exceptions</H2>

#GP(0) for an illegal memory operand effective address in the CS, DS,
ES, FS, or GS segments; #SS(0) for an illegal address in the SS segment;
#PF(fault-code) for a page fault

<H2>Real Address Mode Exceptions</H2>

Interrupt 13 if any part of the operand would lie outside of the effective
address space from 0 to 0FFFFH

<H2>Virtual 8086 Mode Exceptions</H2>

Same exceptions as in Real Address Mode; #PF(fault-code) for a page
fault
