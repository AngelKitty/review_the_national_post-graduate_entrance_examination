<H1>2.3  Registers</H1>
The 80386 contains a total of sixteen registers that are of interest to the
applications programmer. As 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</A>
  shows, these registers may be
grouped into these basic categories:
<OL>
<LI>General registers. These eight 32-bit general-purpose registers are
used primarily to contain operands for arithmetic and logical
operations.
<LI>Segment registers. These special-purpose registers permit systems
software designers to choose either a flat or segmented model of
memory organization. These six registers determine, at any given time,
which segments of memory are currently addressable.
<LI>Status and instruction registers. These special-purpose registers are
used to record and alter certain aspects of the 80386 processor state.
</OL>

<H2>2.3.1  General Registers</H2>
The general registers of the 80386 are the 32-bit registers EAX, EBX, ECX,
EDX, EBP, ESP, ESI, and EDI. These registers are used interchangeably to
contain the operands of logical and arithmetic operations. They may also be
used interchangeably for operands of address computations (except that ESP
cannot be used as an index operand).
<P>
As 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</A>
  shows, the low-order word of each of these eight registers
has a separate name and can be treated as a unit. This feature is useful for
handling 16-bit data items and for compatibility with the 8086 and 80286
processors. The word registers are named AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SP, SI, and DI.
<P>

<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</A>
  also illustrates that each byte of the 16-bit registers AX, BX,
CX, and DX has a separate name and can be treated as a unit. This feature is
useful for handling characters and other 8-bit data items. The byte
registers are named AH, BH, CH, and DH (high bytes); and AL, BL, CL, and DL
(low bytes).
<P>
All of the general-purpose registers are available for addressing
calculations and for the results of most arithmetic and logical
calculations; however, a few functions are dedicated to certain registers.
By implicitly choosing registers for these functions, the 80386 architecture
can encode instructions more compactly. The instructions that use specific
registers include: double-precision multiply and divide, I/O, string
instructions, translate, loop, variable shift and rotate, and stack
operations.

<H2>2.3.2  Segment Registers</H2>
The segment registers of the 80386 give systems software designers the
flexibility to choose among various models of memory organization.
Implementation of memory models is the subject of Part II -- Systems
Programming. Designers may choose a model in which applications programs do
not need to modify segment registers, in which case applications programmers
may skip this section.
<P>
Complete programs generally consist of many different modules, each
consisting of instructions and data. However, at any given time during
program execution, only a small subset of a program's modules are actually
in use. The 80386 architecture takes advantage of this by providing
mechanisms to support direct access to the instructions and data of the
current module's environment, with access to additional segments on demand.
<P>
At any given instant, six segments of memory may be immediately accessible
to an executing 80386 program. The segment registers CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, and
GS are used to identify these six current segments. Each of these registers
specifies a particular kind of segment, as characterized by the associated
mnemonics ("code," "data," or "stack") shown in 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-6">Figure 2-6</A>
  . Each register
uniquely determines one particular segment, from among the segments that
make up the program, that is to be immediately accessible at highest speed.
<P>
The segment containing the currently executing sequence of instructions is
known as the current code segment; it is specified by means of the CS
register. The 80386 fetches all instructions from this code segment, using
as an offset the contents of the instruction pointer. CS is changed
implicitly as the result of intersegment control-transfer instructions (for
example, <A HREF="CALL.htm">CALL</A> and 
<A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/JMP.html">JMP</A>), interrupts, and exceptions.
<P>
Subroutine calls, parameters, and procedure activation records usually
require that a region of memory be allocated for a stack. All stack
operations use the SS register to locate the stack. Unlike CS, the SS
register can be loaded explicitly, thereby permitting programmers to define
stacks dynamically.
<P>
The DS, ES, FS, and GS registers allow the specification of four data
segments, each addressable by the currently executing program. Accessibility
to four separate data areas helps programs efficiently access different
types of data structures; for example, one data segment register can point
to the data structures of the current module, another to the exported data
of a higher-level module, another to a dynamically created data structure,
and another to data shared with another task. An operand within a data
segment is addressed by specifying its offset either directly in an
instruction or indirectly via general registers.
<P>
Depending on the structure of data (e.g., the way data is parceled into one
or more segments), a program may require access to more than four data
segments. To access additional segments, the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers
can be changed under program control during the course of a program's
execution. This simply requires that the program execute an instruction to
load the appropriate segment register prior to executing instructions that
access the data.
<P>
The processor associates a base address with each segment selected by a
segment register. To address an element within a segment, a 32-bit offset is
added to the segment's base address. Once a segment is selected (by loading
the segment selector into a segment register), a data manipulation
instruction only needs to specify the offset. Simple rules define which
segment register is used to form an address when only an offset is
specified.

<H2>2.3.3  Stack Implementation</H2>
Stack operations are facilitated by three registers:
<OL>
<LI>The stack segment (SS) register. Stacks are implemented in memory. A
system may have a number of stacks that is limited only by the maximum
number of segments. A stack may be up to 4 gigabytes long, the maximum
length of a segment. One stack is directly addressable at a --
one located by SS. This is the current stack, often referred to simply
as "the" stack. SS is used automatically by the processor for all
stack operations.

<LI>The stack pointer (ESP) register. ESP points to the top of the
push-down stack (TOS). It is referenced implicitly by <A HREF="PUSH.htm">PUSH</A> and <A HREF="https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/readings/i386/POP.html">POP</A>
operations, subroutine calls and returns, and interrupt operations.
When an item is pushed onto the stack (see 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-7">Figure 2-7</A>
  ), the processor
decrements ESP, then writes the item at the new TOS. When an item is
popped off the stack, the processor copies it from TOS, then
increments ESP. In other words, the stack grows down in memory toward
lesser addresses.

<LI>The stack-frame base pointer (EBP) register. The EBP is the best
choice of register for accessing data structures, variables and
dynamically allocated work space within the stack. EBP is often used
to access elements on the stack relative to a fixed point on the stack
rather than relative to the current TOS. It typically identifies the
base address of the current stack frame established for the current
procedure. When EBP is used as the base register in an offset
calculation, the offset is calculated automatically in the current
stack segment (i.e., the segment currently selected by SS). Because
SS does not have to be explicitly specified, instruction encoding in
such cases is more efficient. EBP can also be used to index into
segments addressable via other segment registers.

<H2>2.3.4  Flags Register</H2>
The flags register is a 32-bit register named EFLAGS. 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-8">Figure 2-8</A>
  defines
the bits within this register. The flags control certain operations and
indicate the status of the 80386.
<P>
The low-order 16 bits of EFLAGS is named FLAGS and can be treated as a
unit. This feature is useful when executing 8086 and 80286 code, because
this part of EFLAGS is identical to the FLAGS register of the 8086 and the
80286.
<P>
The flags may be considered in three groups: the status flags, the control
flags, and the systems flags. Discussion of the systems flags is delayed
until Part II.

          NOTE: 0 OR 1 INDICATES INTEL RESERVED. DO NOT DEFINE

</PRE>
<P>
<H3>2.3.4.1  Status Flags</H3>
The status flags of the EFLAGS register allow the results of one
instruction to influence later instructions. The arithmetic instructions use
OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF. The SCAS (Scan String), <A HREF="CMPS.htm">CMPS</A> (Compare String),
and <A HREF="LOOP.htm">LOOP</A> instructions use ZF to signal that their operations are complete.
There are instructions to set, clear, and complement CF before execution of
an arithmetic instruction. Refer to <A HREF="appc.htm">Appendix C</A> for definition of each
status flag.

<H3>2.3.4.2  Control Flag</H3>
The control flag DF of the EFLAGS register controls string instructions.

DF (Direction Flag, bit 10)

Setting DF causes string instructions to auto-decrement; that is, to
process strings from high addresses to low addresses. Clearing DF causes
string instructions to auto-increment, or to process strings from low
addresses to high addresses.

<H3>2.3.4.3  Instruction Pointer</H3>
The instruction pointer register (EIP) contains the offset address,
relative to the start of the current code segment, of the next sequential
instruction to be executed. The instruction pointer is not directly visible
to the programmer; it is controlled implicitly by control-transfer
instructions, interrupts, and exceptions.
<P>
As 
<A HREF="s02_03.htm#fig2-9">Figure 2-9</A>
  shows, the low-order 16 bits of EIP is named IP and can be
used by the processor as a unit. This feature is useful when executing
instructions designed for the 8086 and 80286 processors.
